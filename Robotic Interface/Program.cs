/*
Objectives:
• Change your abstract RobotCommand class into an IRobotCommand interface.
• Remove the unnecessary public and abstract keywords from the Run method.
• Change the Robot class to use IRobotCommand instead of RobotCommand.
• Make all of your commands implement this new interface instead of extending the RobotCommand
class that no longer exists. You will also want to remove the override keywords in these classes.
• Ensure your program still compiles and runs.
• Answer this question: Do you feel this is an improvement over using an abstract base class? Why or why not?
    My answer: I don't think it's neceserally an improvement, but an alternative. Makes for sligtly cleaner code, not having the public/abstract
    and override everywhere, but that's about it.
